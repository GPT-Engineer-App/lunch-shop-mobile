# lunch-shop-mobile

Hello, I would like to make a mobile app like the one for dominoes but for a lunch shop, which do you recommend I use? For this, I have this plan:

User Interface (UI) Design:

Home screen: An attractive logo and and a menu options to log in or register, and a shortcut to the menu.
Map: An interactive map showing luch shop locations.
Product Menu: List of available luch with photos, descriptions and prices.
Shopping Cart: Shows the selected products and allows you to proceed to payment.
Order tracking: Order status in real time.
Main Features:

Login and registration: Allow users to create accounts and save information from previous orders.
Store Search: Use the user's location to show the nearest stores.
Product Selection: Allow users to browse and select cakes from the menu.
Shopping Cart and Payment: Integrate a shopping cart system and secure payment options.
Notifications and tracking: Inform users about the status of their order.
